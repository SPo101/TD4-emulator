### TD4 emulator

Here I present you written by my own TD4 processor emulator. 
You can load into it's ROM your instructions in hex format, then TD4  will execute them. 

Line of code that is executed rigth now will be highlited by red. When processor will need an input, input space will be highlited by green.



Here some programs for TD4:
